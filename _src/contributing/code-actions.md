# Code Actions (a.k.a. Assists)

_Code actions_, also known as _assists_, are small local refactorings, often rendered in the text editor using a light bulb icon (ðŸ’¡). They are triggered by either clicking the light bulb icon in the editor or by using a shortcut.

Code actions often provide the user with possible corrective actions right next to an error or warning (known as a _diagnostic_ message using LSP jargon). They can also occur independently of diagnostics.

Here is an example of a _code action_ prompting the user to _add an EDoc comment_ for a function which lacks Erlang EDoc documentation.

![Code Action - Add Edoc](../../static/img/code-action-add-edoc.png)

And this is what the code looks like after the suggestion has been applied:

![Code Action - Add Edoc Fix](../../static/img/code-action-add-edoc-fix.png)

## The _Code Action_ request

Code actions are requested by the editor using the [textDocument/codeAction](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_codeAction) LSP request. Code action requests are handled by the `handlers::handle_code_action` function in the `elp` crate.

## Adding a new code action

In this section we will go through the process of adding a new code action from scratch. The code action (or _assist_) will suggest the user to delete a function, if it is deemed as unused by the Erlang compiler.

### Creating the handler

Let's start by creating a new file named `delete_function.rs`, containing a single function declaration:

```rust title="crates/ide_assists/src/handlers/delete_function.rs"
use crate::assist_context::{Assists, AssistContext};

pub(crate) fn delete_function(acc: &mut Assists, ctx: &AssistContext) -> Option<()> {
    todo!()
}
```

Before we can start implementing our code action, there's one more thing we need to do: ensure our new function is invoked by adding it to the list of _ELP assists_. Open the `crates/ide_assists/src/lib.rs` file and amend the list of handlers:

```rust title="crates/ide_assists/src/lib.rs"
mod handlers {
    [...]
    mod delete_function
    [...]

    pub(crate) fn all() -> &'static [Handler] {
        &[
            [...]
            delete_function:delete_function,
            [...]
        ]
    }
}
```

### Adding a test case

The easiest way to verify our new code action behaves in the expected way is to start with a test case. ELP allows us to write tests in a very intuitive and straightforward way.

Add the following to the `delete_function.rs` file:

```rust title="crates/ide_assists/src/handlers/delete_function.rs"
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use expect_test::expect;

    use super::*;
    use crate::tests::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_delete_unused_function() {
        check_assist(
            delete_function,
            "Remove the unused function `heavy_calculations/1`",
            r#"
     -module(life).

     heavy_cal~culations(X) ->
  %% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ L1230: Function heavy_calculations/1 is unused
       X.

     meaning() ->
       42.
"#,
            expect![[
                r#"
                   -module(life).

                   meaning() ->
                     42.
            "#]],
        )
    }
}
```

There is a lot happening here, so let's go through the code. We are defining a new test, named `test_delete_unused_function`, which uses an auxiliary function (`check_assist`) to verify that a given assist behaves as expected.

The `check_assist` function takes 4 arguments:

* The assist _handler_ (`delete_function`)
* A _label_ for the assist
* An input fixture representing what the code looks like **before** a fix is applied
* An output fixture (wrapped in an `expect` macro) showing what the code looks like **after** a fix is applied

The `~` in the first snippet represents the cursor position. We are asserting that - given a diagnostic message pointing to the unused function - if the user triggers the respective code action when the cursor is hovering the function name range, the unused function gets deleted.

Let's try running the test, it should fail with a _not yet implemented_ error:

```
$ cargo test --package elp_ide_assists --lib -- handlers::delete_function::tests::test_delete_unused_function --exact --nocapture

[...]
---- handlers::delete_function::tests::test_delete_unused_function stdout ----
thread 'handlers::delete_function::tests::test_delete_unused_function' panicked at 'not yet implemented', crates/ide_assists/src/handlers/delete_function.rs:21:5
[...]
```

### Diagnostic Annotations and Error Codes

Before starting with the actual implementation, let's for a second go back to the syntax we used to specify the _unused function_ diagnostic:

```
%% ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ðŸ’¡ L1230: Function heavy_calculations/1 is unused
```

This is a test _annotation_ which is used by the ELP testing framework to populate the "context" which is passed to our handler. This is a way to simulate diagnostics coming from external sources (such as the Erlang compiler or a linter), which would be received by the Language Server as part of a `textDocument/codeAction` request.

The annotation has the following format:

```
[\s]%% [^]* ðŸ’¡ CODE: MESSAGE
```

Essentially, a number of spaces, followed by the `%%` which resembles an Erlang comment, a light bulb, a _code_ identifying the diagnostic type and a string message. The _code_  is an _unofficial error_ code which is emitted by both ELP's _Erlang Service_ (see the `erlang_service:make_code/2` function in `erlang_service/src/erlang_service.erl`) and by the [Erlang LS](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/) language server. The idea is to eventually standardize Erlang error messages and to build what, in the end, should be similar to the [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html) or [Haskell](https://errors.haskell.org/) error indexes. In our case, `L1230` is the error corresponding to the `unused_function` diagnostic. The _message_ is a free text string that accompanies the diagnostic.

### Matching on the diagnostic error code

To be able to match the `L1230` error code, we need to add a new variant to the `AssistContextDiagnosticCode` enum. Open the `crates/ide_db/src/assists.rs` file and include the new error code. Don't forget to map it to the `L1230` string.

```rust title="crates/ide_db/src/assists.rs"
pub enum AssistContextDiagnosticCode {
    UnusedFunction, // <--- Add this
    [...]
    UnusedVariable,
}

impl FromStr for AssistContextDiagnosticCode {
    type Err = String;
    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {
        match s {
            "L1230" => Ok(AssistContextDiagnosticCode::UnusedFunction), // <--- Add this
            [...]
            "L1268" => Ok(AssistContextDiagnosticCode::UnusedVariable),
            unknown => Err(format!("Unknown AssistContextDiagnosticCode: '{unknown}'")),
        }
    }
}
```

We are all set. Time to implement the `delete_function` function!

### The implementation

Let's look at our function again.

```
pub(crate) fn delete_function(acc: &mut Assists, ctx: &AssistContext) -> Option<()> {
    todo!()
}
```

We have two input arguments: a mutable _accumulator_ which contains the list of code actions (or _assists_) which we want to return and a _context_, from which we can extract diagnostics.

The following code iterates through the list of diagnostics and, for each diagnostic matching the `UnusedFunction` kind, prints the diagnostic for debugging purposes. We return `Some(())` to comply with the function signature.

```
use elp_ide_db::assists::AssistContextDiagnosticCode;

[...]
pub(crate) fn delete_function(acc: &mut Assists, ctx: &AssistContext) -> Option<()> {
    for d in ctx.diagnostics {
        if let AssistContextDiagnosticCode::UnusedFunction = d.code {
            dbg!(d);
            todo!()
        }
    }
    Some(())
}
[...]

```

If we run the test, we can see what a diagnostic looks like:

```
$ cargo test --package elp_ide_assists --lib -- handlers::delete_function::tests::test_delete_unused_function --exact --nocapture

[...]
running 1 test
[crates/ide_assists/src/handlers/delete_function.rs:25] d = AssistContextDiagnostic {
    code: UnusedFunction,
    message: "Function heavy_calculations/1 is unused",
    range: 24..40,
}
[...]
```

The diagnostic contains the error code and message, together with its range. What we want to do is:

* Find the function declaration which is pointed by the diagnostic range
* Create a code action to remove the function declaration and add it to the accumulator

How do we find the element which the range covers? Context to the rescue! There's a handy `find_node_at_custom_offset` function we can use. The _offset_ here indicates the number of bytes from the beginning of the file. We can use the beginning of the diagnostic range for our purposes.

```
let function_declaration: ast::FunDecl = ctx.find_node_at_custom_offset::<ast::FunDecl>(d.range.start())?;
let function_range = function_declaration.syntax().text_range();
```

Let's extract the function name/arity and produce a nice message for the user:

```
let function_name = function_declaration.name()?;
let function_arity = function_declaration.arity_value()?;
let message = format!("Remove the unused function `{function_name}/{function_arity}`");
```

With the information we have, we can now create a new code action and add it to the accumulator:

```
let id = AssistId("delete_function", AssistKind::QuickFix);
let function_range = function_declaration.syntax().text_range();
acc.add(id,
    message,
    function_range,
    |builder| {
        builder.edit_file(ctx.frange.file_id);
        builder.delete(function_range)
    },
);
```

The `add` function takes four arguments:

* An internal `AssistId` made of a unique string (the `"delete_function"` string in our case) and a `Kind`. We are specifying `QuickFix` in our case, but have a look to the [LSP specifications](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#codeActionKind) to get a list of the available kinds.
* A message which will be rendered to the user (`"Delete the unused function: [FUNCTION_NAME]"`)
* The range of the function. Notice how the range we got from the diagnostic was covering only the _name_ of the function, but we need to delete the whole function, so we need to pass the full range.
* A function which takes a `builder` as its input and uses it to manipulate the source file. Here we are saying that we want to edit the current file (we extract the `file_id` from the `ctx` context) and that we simply want to delete the range of the function declaration.

Yes. It's as simple as that. For completeness, here is the full function implementation:

```
pub(crate) fn delete_function(acc: &mut Assists, ctx: &AssistContext) -> Option<()> {
    for d in ctx.diagnostics {
        if let AssistContextDiagnosticCode::UnusedFunction = d.code {
            let function_declaration: ast::FunDecl =
                ctx.find_node_at_custom_offset::<ast::FunDecl>(d.range.start())?;
            let function_name = function_declaration.name()?;
            let function_arity = function_declaration.arity_value()?;
            let function_range = function_declaration.syntax().text_range();

            let id = AssistId("delete_function", AssistKind::QuickFix);
            let message = format!("Remove the unused function `{function_name}/{function_arity}`");
            acc.add(id, message, function_range, |builder| {
                builder.edit_file(ctx.frange.file_id);
                builder.delete(function_range)
            });
        }
    }
    Some(())
}
```

You can look at existing assists for more complex manipulation examples.

# Try it yourself

What we wrote is a unit test, but there's nothing better than checking ourselves the behaviour in the IDE.

Compile the `elp` executable:

```
cargo build
```

Then visit the Erlang extension settings page and edit the `elp.path` value to point to the newly built executable, which should reside in:

```
./debug/elp
```

Open VS Code (or reload the window if you have it already open) and visit an Erlang file which contains an unused function. You should see something like:

![Code Action - Remove Function](../../static/img/code-action-remove-function.png)

If that worked, congratulations! You managed to write your first ELP code action!
