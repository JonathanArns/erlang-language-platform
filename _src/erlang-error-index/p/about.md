# About

The `P` namespace is reserved for error codes emitted by the Erlang parser [erl_parse](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl_parse).

The `erl_parse` module is the basic Erlang parser that converts tokens into the abstract form of either forms (that is, top-level constructs), expressions, or terms.

For more information about `erl_parse` please refer to [the official documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erl_parse).
