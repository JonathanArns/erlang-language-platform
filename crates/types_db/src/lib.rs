//! Types for use in HIR but which can also be produced by other code
//! intelligence sources, such as Eqwalizer, OTP compiler,
//! common_test.
//!
//! This crate carries the types only, so they can be used in
//! hir::Semantic, without concern for the messy details of actually
//! retrieving them.
//!
//! This also allows us to set up test fixtures to populate them
//! without running heavyweight processes.
